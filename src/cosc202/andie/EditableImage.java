/**
 * <p>
 * An image with a set of operations applied to it.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The EditableImage represents an image with a series of operations applied to
 * it. It is fairly core to the ANDIE program, being the central data structure.
 * The operations are applied to a copy of the original image so that they can
 * undo back to the original image.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Internally the EditableImage has two {@link BufferedImage}s - the original
 * image
 * and the result of applying the current set of operations to it.
 * The operations themselves are stored on a {@link Stack}, with a second
 * {@link Stack}
 * being used to allow undone operations to be redone.
